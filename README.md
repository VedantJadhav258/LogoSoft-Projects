## 🚧 Projects Overview

⚡ 3-time lamp switching.lld
Sequentially switches three lamps ON and OFF at preset intervals. Demonstrates the usage of multiple timers in series to control independent outputs.

🔄 counter basic.lld
Implements a simple counter that increments with each input pulse and triggers an output when a preset value is reached—excellent for part counting or production batch detection.


🔒 latching.lld
Classic PLC “seal-in” logic: press a Start button to latch power ON, and press Stop to release. Teaches relay-like memory using self‑holding circuits. 


🔁 Star-delta starter.lld
Automates a three-phase motor’s Star-to-Delta transition using a timer to reduce inrush current on startup. Includes timing sequence and interlocks for safe switching.

⏱ timer ladder.lld
Demonstrates a simple ON-delay timer circuit: activate input, wait preset delay, then turn output ON. Great intro to TON instructions in ladder logic. 


💡 Circuit Diagram1.lsc
Circuit diagram for a basic control application (e.g., lamp or motor). Visualizes inputs, outputs, interlocks, and device connections—useful for understanding how ladder logic translates to real hardware.
